## Understanding Light Metrics

### PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density)
Measured in µmol/m²/s — the number of photons hitting one square meter per second. This is what matters for plant growth, not watts.

### DLI (Daily Light Integral)
Total moles of light received per day. DLI = PPFD × hours / 1,000,000
- Seedling: DLI 15–25 mol/m²/day
- Vegetative: DLI 25–40 mol/m²/day
- Flowering: DLI 40–65 mol/m²/day

### PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation)
The spectrum range (400–700 nm) that plants use for photosynthesis. Full-spectrum lights that cover the entire PAR range are ideal.

### Efficacy (µmol/J)
How efficiently a light converts electricity into photons. Modern LEDs: 2.0–3.0+ µmol/J. HPS: ~1.7 µmol/J.

## LED (Light Emitting Diode)

### Overview
Modern full-spectrum LEDs are the top choice for home growers and increasingly for commercial operations. High efficiency, low heat, long lifespan.

### Quality LED Brands
- HLG (Horticulture Lighting Group) — Industry benchmark
- Spider Farmer, Mars Hydro — Good value for home growers
- Gavita, Fluence — Commercial grade

### LED PPFD Targets
| Stage | PPFD Target |
|---|---|
| Seedling | 200–400 µmol/m²/s |
| Early Veg | 400–600 µmol/m²/s |
| Peak Veg | 600–800 µmol/m²/s |
| Early Flower | 700–900 µmol/m²/s |
| Peak Flower | 900–1200 µmol/m²/s |

Note: LEDs can run at higher PPFD with less heat stress compared to HPS. Gradually increase PPFD; don't jump from low to maximum instantly.

### Hanging Heights
- 4x4 tent with 600W LED: Start at 24", lower to 18–20" at peak flower
- Always follow manufacturer's recommendations for your specific light
- Use a PAR meter to confirm actual PPFD at canopy level

## HPS (High Pressure Sodium)

### Overview
The industry standard for decades. Proven results, consistent yields. More heat produced requires better ventilation.

### HPS Configuration
- 400W HPS: Suitable for 2x4 ft or 3x3 ft
- 600W HPS: Industry-preferred for 4x4 ft
- 1000W HPS: 5x5 to 6x6 ft

### Heat Management
HPS produces significant heat:
- Use digital ballasts (reduce heat and increase efficiency by 10–15%)
- Air-cooled hoods (extract hot air through the light) are essential in sealed rooms
- Expect 10–15°F temperature rise with HPS; plan ventilation accordingly

### HPS Strengths
- Proven penetration for dense canopies
- Inexpensive initial setup cost
- High red spectrum (good for flower)

## CMH / LEC (Ceramic Metal Halide / Light Emitting Ceramic)

### Overview
CMH provides a full-spectrum light including UV wavelengths that LEDs often lack. Associated with excellent terpene and cannabinoid production.

### CMH Details
- Most common: 315W and 630W configurations
- Full spectrum (4000K for veg, 3100K for flower, or "all-cycle" 3100K)
- UV output stimulates resin production
- Less heat than HPS, more than LED
- Bulbs need replacement every 10,000–15,000 hours

### Best Use Case
Quality-focused growers who prioritize terpene profile and cannabinoid potency over yield.

## Fluorescent (T5 / CFL)

### Best For
- Seedlings and early veg only
- Mother plants
- Cloning

### Limitations
- Insufficient PPFD for flower production
- Cannot penetrate canopy more than 6–12 inches
- Use at 2–4" from canopy for best effect

## Light Schedules

### Photoperiod Strains
| Stage | Schedule |
|---|---|
| Vegetative | 18 hours on / 6 hours off |
| Flowering | 12 hours on / 12 hours off |
| Some breeders recommend | 20/4 for veg, 11/13 for fast finishers |

**Critical:** Dark period must be completely uninterrupted during flower. Even a brief light leak can re-vegetate plants or cause hermaphroditism.

### Autoflower Strains
- 18/6 or 20/4 throughout entire life cycle
- More light hours = more photosynthesis = more yield (up to the plant's saturation point)

## Light Burn vs. Light Bleaching

**Light burn:** Bleached/white upper leaves and buds, most often white or yellow at the very top. Caused by excessive PPFD at close range.
- Fix: Raise the light; reduce intensity if dimmable
- Different from heat stress (which causes leaf edges to curl and brown, not bleach)

**Prevention:** Use a PAR meter; don't exceed 1200–1400 µmol/m²/s without CO2 supplementation (plants cannot process more light than they have CO2 to fuel).
