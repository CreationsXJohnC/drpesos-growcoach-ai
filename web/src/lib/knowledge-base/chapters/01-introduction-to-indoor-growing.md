# Chapter 1: Introduction to Indoor Growing — The Dr. Pesos Method

## Why Indoor Growing?

Indoor cultivation gives you complete control over your plant's environment — temperature, humidity, light cycles, nutrients, and airflow. With that control comes responsibility: you become the sun, the rain, and the soil. Done right, indoor growing produces top-shelf, consistent, high-quality cannabis year-round regardless of outdoor conditions.

The Dr. Pesos method is built on one core principle: **work with the plant, not against it**. Cannabis is resilient. Your job is to provide the optimal environment and then observe, adjust, and respond.

## The Indoor Growing Cycle Overview

A complete indoor cannabis grow from seed to jarred product follows these stages:

1. **Germination** (3–7 days) — The seed cracks and a taproot emerges
2. **Seedling** (1–3 weeks) — First true leaves develop; plant is fragile
3. **Vegetative Stage** (4–8 weeks for photoperiod) — Rapid leaf and stem growth; build canopy structure
4. **Flowering Stage** (8–12 weeks depending on strain) — Bud development triggered by 12/12 light schedule
5. **Harvest** (Day 1 of flush to harvest, 7–14 days) — Trichome assessment, final flush
6. **Drying** (10–14 days) — Slow, controlled moisture removal at 60°F / 60% RH
7. **Curing** (4–8+ weeks) — Burp jars daily, improve aroma and smoothness

## What You Need to Get Started

### Minimum Equipment List
- **Grow tent or dedicated room** — Light-sealed, reflective interior
- **Lighting** — LED, HPS, or CMH (see Chapter 8: Lighting Systems)
- **Ventilation** — Inline fan + carbon filter (1 complete air exchange per minute)
- **Growing medium** — Soil, coco coir, rockwool, or hydro system
- **Nutrients** — Base nutrients + supplements (Advanced Nutrients recommended)
- **pH meter and pH adjusters** — Critical for nutrient availability
- **EC/PPM meter** — For monitoring nutrient concentration
- **Thermometer/hygrometer** — Digital with min/max memory
- **Timers** — For lights and irrigation
- **Containers** — 1–5 gallon fabric pots (soil/coco) or net pots (hydro)

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid
- **Overwatering** — The #1 killer of young plants. Water only when the top inch of soil is dry or when the pot feels light.
- **Over-feeding** — More nutrients ≠ faster growth. Start at 50% of recommended dose and increase gradually.
- **Incorrect pH** — Even perfect nutrients are useless at wrong pH. Test every watering.
- **Ignoring VPD** — Vapor Pressure Deficit affects transpiration and nutrient uptake. See Chapter 9.
- **Harvesting too early** — Patience is the most valuable tool in your grow kit.

## The Dr. Pesos Philosophy

Dr. Pesos Grow Coach AI is built on the We Grow Life methodology developed by Ori Company. Our approach emphasizes:

- **Simplicity first** — Understand the basics before adding complexity
- **Observation over intervention** — Most problems are caused by doing too much, not too little
- **Quality over quantity** — A well-executed small grow beats a rushed large one
- **Defoliation as a science** — Dr. Pesos' signature defoliation schedule (see Chapter 10) improves light penetration and air circulation at specific, data-driven intervals
- **Consistent environmental targets** — Stable parameters outperform "optimal" parameters that fluctuate

## Legal Compliance Notice

Always verify local regulations before growing cannabis. Rules vary by jurisdiction. This guide is for educational purposes and cultivation in areas where it is legally permitted.
