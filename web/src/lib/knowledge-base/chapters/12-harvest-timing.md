# Chapter 12: Harvest Timing — Reading Your Plant

## The Most Common Harvest Mistake

Harvesting too early. Most growers — especially first-timers — harvest 1–2 weeks before peak maturity. The result is lower potency, reduced weight, and a more energetic/anxious effect profile rather than the full, balanced high the plant is capable of producing.

Patience is the most valuable harvest tool.

## The Two-Indicator System

Always use both indicators together. Never rely on just one.

### Indicator 1: Trichome Assessment (Primary)

Trichomes are the tiny crystal-like structures (resin glands) covering buds and surrounding leaves. They produce and store cannabinoids and terpenes.

**What you need:** A jeweler's loupe (30x–60x) or digital microscope (100x+)
**Where to look:** The bud's sugar leaves and calyx wall (not fan leaves — they mature differently)

**Trichome Stages:**

| Trichome Appearance | Stage | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Clear/translucent (glass-like) | Under-developed | Too early — wait |
| Milky/cloudy white (fully opaque) | Peak THC | Harvest for cerebral/energetic effect |
| 10–20% amber, rest milky | Harvest window | Balanced, full, potent — Dr. Pesos sweet spot |
| 30–50% amber | Ripening past peak | Heavier sedative effect; more CBN forming |
| 50%+ amber | Over-ripe | Degraded cannabinoids; mostly sedative/CBN |

**Dr. Pesos Harvest Recommendation:**
- **Sativa/sativa-dominant strains:** Harvest at 5–15% amber (more uplifting, cerebral effect preserved)
- **Indica/indica-dominant strains:** Harvest at 15–25% amber (more body effect, relaxation)
- **Medical/sleep focus:** 25–35% amber
- **Hybrid strains:** 10–20% amber for the best of both worlds

### Indicator 2: Pistil Color (Secondary)

Pistils are the hair-like structures on the buds. They start white and progressively darken to orange/brown as the plant matures.

| Pistil Color | Maturity Level |
|---|---|
| 50–70% orange/brown | Getting close — check trichomes |
| 70–85% orange/brown | Usually in or near harvest window |
| 90%+ orange/brown | Likely at or past peak — check trichomes immediately |

**Important:** Pistil color alone is not reliable. Pistils can darken early due to environmental stress, touching, or pruning — not just maturity. Always confirm with trichome assessment.

## Pre-Harvest Checklist

### 7–14 Days Before Harvest: Begin Flush
- Switch to plain pH-adjusted water (or water + Flawless Finish at 2 mL/gal)
- Test runoff EC and continue flushing until it's below 200–400 ppm
- The flush removes excess nutrients from the plant tissue and medium, improving final taste

### 48–72 Hours Before Harvest: Final Observation
- Check trichomes under loupe — confirm majority are in your target ratio
- Ensure plants are well-hydrated (water the day before harvest)
- Inspect all buds for any signs of mold or botrytis — any infected bud must be removed immediately

### The Night Before Harvest
Some growers run a final 24–48 hours of complete darkness before harvest, believing it encourages the plant to push remaining resin to the surface.
- Evidence is anecdotal but the practice is low-risk
- Keep temperature and humidity stable during the dark period
- Not required for great results

## Harvest Day

### Tools Needed
- Clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears
- Isopropyl alcohol (91%+) for cleaning scissors every few plants
- Gloves (keep resin off your hands)
- Trimming tray or tray with sides
- Buckets or hangers for harvested branches

### Harvesting Order
Large plants: Consider a "staggered harvest" — harvest the top 2–3 colas first (most mature), then allow the lower, less-exposed buds to continue developing for an additional 5–10 days.

### Cutting Protocol
1. Cut entire plant or large branches at the base
2. Remove large fan leaves immediately (these won't be part of the final product)
3. Hang the whole plant or large branches upside down, or cut to individual branches for drying

## Wet Trimming vs. Dry Trimming

### Wet Trimming
- Trim sugar leaves off buds while still fresh (before drying)
- Pros: Faster drying; easier to trim when moist; reduces mold risk in humid climates
- Cons: Loses some terpenes (the act of trimming bruises trichomes); harder on scissors (resin clogs)

### Dry Trimming (Dr. Pesos Recommended)
- Hang entire branches and dry first; trim after drying
- Pros: Slower, more controlled dry; protects trichomes; better aroma
- Cons: Requires more drying space; if humidity is too high, mold risk increases

**Dr. Pesos recommends dry trimming** for home growers prioritizing quality. Wet trimming is acceptable for large commercial runs where drying space and speed are priorities.
