# Chapter 15: Commercial Growing — SOPs, KPIs, and Batch Planning

## The Commercial Mindset Shift

Commercial cannabis cultivation is not hobby growing at scale. It is a manufacturing operation. Every decision must be evaluated against three criteria: **quality**, **consistency**, and **efficiency**.

The same techniques that produce exceptional results for a home grower — intuition, observation, one-off adjustments — become liabilities at scale. They must be replaced with:
- Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Preventive maintenance schedules
- Traceability from seed to sale

## Facility Organization

### Room Types
A well-designed commercial facility separates operations into distinct zones:

| Room | Function |
|---|---|
| Propagation / Clone Room | Clones and seedlings; 18/6 or 24h light; high humidity; isolated from flower |
| Vegetative Room | Veg plants; 18/6 light; airflow; defoliation and training area |
| Flower Rooms (multiple) | 12/12; sealed; dehumidification; CO2; independently controlled |
| Drying Room | Dedicated room at 60–65°F, 55–62% RH; dark; low airflow |
| Processing / Trim Room | Clean room standard; non-porous surfaces; refrigerated storage |
| Sanitation / Chemical Storage | Locked; MSDS sheets posted; PPE available |

### Batch Planning for Continuous Harvest
The goal is a harvest every 1–2 weeks (perpetual harvest model):
- Stagger plant cohorts so flower rooms complete on rolling schedule
- Example (4 flower rooms, 9-week strains): flip one room every ~2 weeks → harvest every 2 weeks
- Maintain a mother room or reliable clone source for consistent genetics

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

SOPs remove variability and ensure consistent results regardless of which team member performs the task.

### Essential SOPs for Every Commercial Grow

**1. Clone/Propagation SOP**
- Clone source selection criteria
- Rooting medium prep and hormone application
- Humidity dome management schedule
- Success criteria for transplant

**2. Transplant SOP**
- Root mass criteria for transplant
- Container sizing by strain/room
- Medium prep and pre-charge protocol
- Irrigation reintroduction schedule

**3. Defoliation SOP (Dr. Pesos Protocol)**
- Week trigger: Defoliation on specific days post-flip (Day 14 and Day 35–42)
- Glove requirements, tool sterilization
- Maximum removal % (30% of leaf mass)
- Recovery observation checklist

**4. Irrigation SOP**
- Frequency by stage and medium
- EC targets by stage
- pH adjustment procedure
- Runoff EC logging frequency

**5. IPM SOP**
- Weekly scouting log (date, plant, observations, pest count if applicable)
- Treatment decision matrix
- Approved chemical list and re-entry intervals
- Quarantine procedures for new plant material

**6. Harvest SOP**
- Trichome assessment protocol (magnification tool, documentation)
- Pre-harvest flush timeline
- Harvest day procedure (tools, sanitization, staging)
- Weight logging: wet weight per room

**7. Drying & Curing SOP**
- Environmental setpoints (temp, RH targets)
- Daily measurement and logging
- Branch/bud removal trigger criteria (snap test, moisture meter reading)
- Jar fill weight and labeling

**8. Sanitation SOP**
- Between-harvest deep clean procedure
- Daily/weekly cleaning tasks per room
- Chemical dilution ratios and application methods
- PPE requirements

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Track these metrics to identify bottlenecks and improve operations:

| KPI | How to Measure | Baseline Target |
|---|---|---|
| Yield per sq ft | Grams dry trim ÷ canopy sq ft | 50–100+ g/sq ft |
| Yield per light | Grams dry trim ÷ number of lights | 500–1000+ g/light |
| Clone success rate | Rooted clones ÷ total taken × 100 | >85% |
| Days to harvest from flip | Actual days to harvest | Strain-dependent ± 3 days |
| Defect rate (% plants with pests/disease) | Affected plants ÷ total × 100 | <5% |
| Trim loss % | (Wet weight − Dry trim weight) ÷ Wet weight | 70–80% loss is normal |
| Potency (THC %) | Lab testing | Track per strain/batch |
| Terpene profile consistency | Lab testing | Batch-to-batch consistency |
| Revenue per sq ft | Gross revenue ÷ total canopy sq ft | Depends on market |
| COGS per gram | All costs ÷ total grams produced | Track and reduce over time |

## Compliance and Traceability

### Seed-to-Sale Tracking
Most licensed states require tracking platforms (Metrc, BioTrackTHC, CCTT). Every plant, batch, and package must be logged:
- Plant tags at cloning
- Batch creation at harvest
- Package creation at processing
- Lab sample submission
- Transfer manifests to dispensary

### Testing Requirements
- Cannabinoid potency (THC, CBD, CBN, etc.)
- Terpene profile
- Pesticide residue panel
- Heavy metals
- Microbial contamination (mold, yeast, E. coli, Salmonella)
- Moisture content
- Water activity

### Compliance Culture
Every team member must understand:
- What they can and cannot do with plants
- How to document deviations from SOPs
- Chain of custody for plant material
- Product diversion prohibitions and consequences

## Workforce Management

### Role Definitions
- **Master Grower:** Responsible for all cultivation decisions, SOP development, strain selection
- **Assistant Grower:** Executes SOPs, daily observations, IPM treatments
- **Cultivation Technician:** Routine tasks (watering, defoliation, harvest support)
- **Quality Assurance:** Traceability, testing coordination, compliance documentation

### Training Protocol
New hires shadow experienced staff for minimum 2 weeks before working independently. All staff must pass written assessment on company SOPs before solo tasks.
