# Chapter 10: Training Techniques & Dr. Pesos Defoliation Protocol

## Why Training Matters

Cannabis grows naturally as a Christmas tree — tall with one dominant main cola. In a grow tent, this is inefficient: only the top bud gets maximum light while lower branches produce smaller "popcorn" buds.

Training manipulates the plant's structure to:
- Create multiple colas at the same height (flat canopy)
- Maximize light coverage across all bud sites
- Improve airflow throughout the canopy
- Increase total yield per grow space

## Low Stress Training (LST)

### Overview
LST involves bending and tying branches downward and outward without cutting. Low risk of stress response; suitable for beginners and autoflowers.

### LST Technique
1. Begin when the main stem is pliable — usually 2–3 weeks after germination
2. Bend the main stem at a 90° angle, away from center
3. Secure with a soft plant tie, wire twist, or LST clip
4. As the plant reaches upward, bend new growth outward to maintain horizontal orientation
5. Check and adjust ties every 1–2 days as the plant grows

**Result:** A radial, fan-like canopy with all growing tips at approximately the same height.

## Topping

### Overview
Removing the apical meristem (main growing tip) redirects growth hormones to side branches, creating two new main colas.

### Topping Technique
1. Wait until the plant has 4–6 nodes
2. Using sterile scissors, cut cleanly above the 4th or 5th node
3. The plant will produce two new colas from the node below the cut
4. Allow 5–7 days recovery before any further training
5. Top again when new growth has produced 3–4 more nodes for further branching

**Caution:** Do NOT top autoflowers unless you have 4+ weeks of vegetative growth remaining. The recovery window is too short on most autos.

## FIMming (F*ck, I Missed)

Similar to topping but instead of a clean cut, you pinch off about 75% of the growing tip.
- Creates 4 new tops instead of 2
- Less stress than full topping
- Useful when plants are in late veg and you want more tops without the full recovery time

## Screen of Green (SCROG)

### Overview
Install a horizontal trellis net (2"–4" mesh) above your plants. As growth extends through the net, weave branches horizontally.

### SCROG Setup
1. Install net at approximately 12–18" above pots
2. Veg until canopy is 50–75% of the screen filled
3. Stop tucking at flip; let vertical growth fill the screen from below
4. Provides excellent support for heavy buds during flower

### Best with: 1–4 plants per 4x4 tent with multiple tops from topping/LST

## Supercropping

### Overview
Controlled high-stress training — bend the stem at a 90° angle until you feel the inner wall compress (slight crunch sound is normal). The stem heals with a knuckle that is actually stronger than the original.

### Use Cases
- Manage stretch: Supercrop branches that are growing too tall
- Increase horizontal spread: Bend a tall branch into a horizontal position
- Stress response: Some growers supercrop during late veg to trigger a stress-related resin response

**Not recommended for sick, deficient, or stressed plants.**

## Dr. Pesos Signature Defoliation Protocol

Defoliation — the removal of fan leaves — is the most impactful and most commonly misunderstood technique. Dr. Pesos' protocol is based on 4 core principles:

1. **Timing is everything** — Defoliate at specific, data-driven intervals; not whenever leaves "look big"
2. **Never more than 30%** — Remove no more than 30% of leaf mass per session to avoid shocking the plant
3. **Healthy plants only** — Never defoliate a deficient, stressed, or sick plant
4. **Recovery time** — Allow 48–72 hours after any defoliation before topping, transplanting, or other stressful procedures

### Vegetative Defoliation Schedule
- **Timing:** Every other week during active vegetative growth
- **Target:** Remove large fan leaves that block light from lower bud sites and interior branching
- **Technique:** Cut at the petiole (leaf stem), not at the node. Leave the petiole stump — it will wither and fall off naturally.
- **Focus areas:** Interior of the canopy where light penetration is poor; overlapping fan leaves from different branches

### Flower Defoliation Schedule

**Session 1 — Early Flower (Week 2–3 of 12/12)**
This is the most impactful defoliation of the entire grow. The plant has just stretched and has many overlapping leaves.
- Remove fan leaves blocking bud sites
- Open up the canopy so light reaches lower branch buds
- Remove 20–30% of leaf mass
- Do not touch the actual bud sites or flowering tops

**Session 2 — Mid Flower (Week 5–6 of 12/12)**
The final defoliation. Buds are well-formed and beginning their final bulking phase.
- Remove fan leaves that are blocking bud sites or creating humidity "pockets"
- Focus on leaves tucked within the canopy, not edge leaves that are photosynthesizing
- Remove no more than 20% of remaining leaf mass
- Leave fan leaves that are still actively green and facing the light

**Absolute cutoff: No defoliation after Week 6 of flower**
During the final ripening phase (weeks 7+), fan leaves are critical for supplying energy to bud development. Removing them at this stage reduces final weight and potentially reduces cannabinoid and terpene content.

## Lollipopping

Remove all lower branching and bud sites that are in the "shadow zone" — below the main canopy level where light cannot reach effectively.

### When to Lollipop
- Just before the flip to flower (last day of veg or day 1 of flower)
- Remove all growth in the bottom 25–30% of the plant
- Focus: leave only the top 70–75% of the plant where light quality is high

### Benefits
- Eliminates popcorn buds that consume energy without producing quality flower
- Improves airflow at lower canopy levels
- Redirects energy to top colas

## Training Strategy by Experience Level

| Level | Recommended Training |
|---|---|
| Beginner | LST + light defoliation |
| Intermediate | LST + topping + SCROG + full defoliation protocol |
| Advanced | All of the above + supercropping + lollipopping |
| Commercial | SCROG + aggressive canopy management + standardized defoliation SOP |
