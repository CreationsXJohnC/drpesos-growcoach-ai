# Chapter 7: Growing Media — Soil, Coco, Hydro, Rockwool

## Choosing Your Medium

Your grow medium is where your plant lives. It determines watering frequency, nutrient delivery, pH management, and ultimately your yield ceiling. Choose based on your experience level, goals, and available time.

## Soil

### Overview
Soil is the most forgiving medium and most similar to the plant's natural habitat. Pre-amended soils contain nutrients that feed the plant for the first several weeks, reducing the need for feeding in early growth.

### Recommended Soils
- **Fox Farm Ocean Forest** — Industry standard. Rich in organic matter. Good for 3–4 weeks with no additional nutrients.
- **Roots Organics Original** — Well-draining, suitable for coco-like watering frequency
- **Build A Soil 3x Mix** — Premium living soil for organic grows

### Soil-Specific Guidelines
- **pH target:** 6.0–7.0 (ideal: 6.2–6.8)
- **Watering frequency:** Every 2–3 days for established plants (let top inch dry between waterings)
- **Container size:** 3–7 gallon fabric pots for most photoperiod strains
- **Runoff:** Aim for 10–20% runoff each watering to prevent salt buildup
- **EC input:** 800–1400 ppm at peak flower

### Pros & Cons
✓ Forgiving of over/underwatering
✓ Pre-amended soil reduces early feeding complexity
✓ Best flavor/aroma results (especially with organic amendments)
✗ Slower growth than coco or hydro
✗ Harder to diagnose and correct problems quickly
✗ Risk of pests (fungus gnats) in moist soil

## Coco Coir

### Overview
Coco coir (coconut fiber) has a neutral pH and no nutrients of its own — it's essentially a hydroponic medium that holds and aerates the root zone. It allows faster growth than soil and precise nutrient control.

### Setting Up Coco
- Rinse and hydrate dry coco thoroughly before use
- Mix with 20–30% perlite for improved drainage and aeration
- Pre-charge with CalMag before first use: soak in CalMag solution at 5–10 mL/gal
- pH target: 5.8–6.2

### Coco-Specific Guidelines
- **Watering frequency:** Daily or twice daily for established plants. Coco must never fully dry out.
- **CalMag requirement:** Coco binds calcium and magnesium. Always supplement. Use 5–10 mL/gal of CalMag in every feeding.
- **EC input:** 1.0–2.0 EC (500–1000 ppm) for veg; 1.5–2.4 EC for flower
- **Runoff EC:** Should be within 0.3–0.5 EC of input. If runoff EC is much higher, flush.

### Pros & Cons
✓ Faster growth than soil — roots love the aeration
✓ Precise nutrient control
✓ No organic matter to house pests
✓ Reusable (with proper sterilization)
✗ Requires daily watering
✗ No buffer — deficiencies appear quickly
✗ Always requires CalMag supplementation

## Deep Water Culture (DWC) Hydroponics

### Overview
Plants are suspended in net pots with roots hanging directly into oxygenated, nutrient-rich water. Fastest growth rate of any medium.

### Setup Components
- Reservoir (opaque to prevent algae)
- Air pump + airstone (high oxygen = faster root growth)
- Net pots + clay pebbles
- Water pump (for recirculating systems)
- pH pen + EC meter (check twice daily)
- Water temperature monitor (keep at 65–72°F — prevents pythium/root rot)

### DWC-Specific Guidelines
- **pH target:** 5.5–6.0 (tighter range than soil)
- **EC management:** Check and adjust daily. Top off with plain pH water to maintain level, then adjust EC.
- **Water temperature:** Critical. Above 72°F invites root rot. Use a water chiller if needed.
- **Oxygen:** More air = faster growth. Use large airstones and an air pump rated for 2x your reservoir volume.
- **Reservoir changes:** Full change every 7–10 days. Sterilize reservoir between changes.

### Pros & Cons
✓ Fastest growth and yield potential
✓ Precise daily nutrient control
✓ Root health visible at any time
✗ Equipment-intensive
✗ No buffer — pH/EC swings are immediately felt
✗ One failure (power outage, pump failure) can kill plants quickly
✗ Higher skill requirement

## Rockwool

### Overview
Rockwool is a mineral fiber growing medium made from spun volcanic rock. It's the dominant medium in large-scale commercial operations worldwide.

### Pre-Treatment (Critical)
Rockwool is naturally alkaline (pH ~7.0). You MUST pre-treat before use:
1. Soak in pH 5.5 water for 24 hours
2. Discard water; re-soak in pH 5.5 water with minimal nutrients for another 4 hours
3. Drain and use immediately

### Rockwool Guidelines
- **pH target:** 5.5–6.0
- **Watering frequency:** Multiple times daily in commercial settings (dripper systems); hand-water every 1–2 days in small setups
- **Never let rockwool dry completely** — it's very hard to rewet evenly
- **Wrap cubes in black/white plastic** if root-zone light exposure is a concern

### Pros & Cons
✓ Industry standard for commercial grows
✓ Sterile medium — no pests
✓ Excellent oxygen-to-water ratio
✓ Easy to transplant between cube sizes
✗ Not biodegradable — environmental concern
✗ Requires careful pH pre-treatment
✗ Can be difficult to manage moisture levels without irrigation automation
