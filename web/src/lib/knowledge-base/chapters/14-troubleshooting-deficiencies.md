# Chapter 14: Troubleshooting — Deficiencies, Toxicities & Disorders

## The Diagnostic Process

When something looks wrong with your plant, follow this diagnostic sequence before reaching for a solution:

1. **Check pH** — 80% of "deficiency" problems are actually pH lockout. Test your water/runoff first.
2. **Check EC/ppm** — Are you feeding too little (deficiency) or too much (toxicity)?
3. **Check environment** — Temperature stress and humidity issues mimic nutrient problems
4. **Examine the affected leaves** — Which leaves? (Old/lower vs. New/upper tells you a lot) What pattern?
5. **Then identify the specific problem**

### Key Diagnostic Rule: Mobile vs. Immobile Nutrients

**Mobile nutrients** (N, P, K, Mg, Mo) can be moved by the plant from old leaves to new growth when deficient. Deficiency symptoms appear on **older, lower leaves first**.

**Immobile nutrients** (Ca, Fe, B, Cu, Mn, Zn, S) cannot be relocated. Deficiency symptoms appear on **new, young growth first**.

## Macronutrient Deficiencies

### Nitrogen Deficiency (N)
**Symptoms:** Yellowing starting from oldest (lowest) leaves, progressing upward. Leaves turn uniformly light green then yellow, eventually dropping. Plant looks pale overall.
**Most Common Cause:** Not feeding enough N, pH too high (above 7.0 in soil), or root problems
**Fix:**
- First, check pH (soil: target 6.2–6.8)
- Increase Nitrogen: add more Grow in base formula; or top dress with blood meal (organic)
- If pH is wrong, correct pH before adding more nutrients

### Phosphorus Deficiency (P)
**Symptoms:** Dark green leaves with purple/red discoloration on underside of leaves, stems, and petioles. Leaves may look shiny or develop blue-green coloration. Lower leaves affected first.
**Most Common Cause:** pH too low (below 6.0 in soil; below 5.5 in coco), cold root zone temperature
**Fix:**
- Bring pH to correct range
- Warm the root zone if temperature is below 65°F
- Supplement with a P-heavy product (Big Bud, Bloom booster)

### Potassium Deficiency (K)
**Symptoms:** Brown, scorched leaf tips and edges, especially on older leaves. Edges progress inward. Leaves may curl upward. Buds may be sparse.
**Most Common Cause:** pH lockout, high EC flushing out K, insufficient K in feed
**Fix:**
- Check pH (K most available at 6.0–7.0 in soil)
- Increase Bloom in AN formula
- Flush if EC is high (salt lockout)

## Secondary Nutrient Deficiencies

### Calcium Deficiency (Ca)
**Symptoms:** Brown spots on new growth and mid-canopy leaves. Spots often have dark brown borders. Tips of new leaves deform and cup upward. Buds may show tip burn.
**Most Common Cause:** pH lockout, insufficient CalMag in coco, low humidity preventing transpiration
**Fix:**
- Supplement with Advanced Nutrients Sensi Cal-Mag Xtra (5–10 mL/gal)
- Adjust pH to 6.2–6.8 (soil) or 5.8–6.2 (coco)
- In coco: CalMag in every watering is non-negotiable

### Magnesium Deficiency (Mg)
**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between the veins while veins remain green) on mid-age leaves. Distinctive pattern — the leaf looks like it's glowing yellow-green between a green network of veins.
**Most Common Cause:** pH lockout, low Mg in feed, coco without CalMag supplementation
**Fix:**
- Foliar spray with 1 tsp/gal Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) as a quick fix
- Supplement with CalMag in feedings
- Adjust pH

### Sulfur Deficiency (S)
**Symptoms:** Yellowing on new growth (similar to N deficiency but affects new leaves first). Stems may also yellow.
**Less common than N, P, K, Ca, Mg deficiencies**
**Fix:** Adjust pH; supplement with a product containing sulfur

## Micronutrient Deficiencies

### Iron Deficiency (Fe)
**Symptoms:** Bright yellow interveinal chlorosis on newest leaves. Very similar to Mg deficiency but appears on new growth (top of plant) first.
**Most Common Cause:** pH too high (above 7.0 in soil); check pH before anything else
**Fix:** Lower pH to 6.0–6.5 in soil or 5.8–6.2 in coco

### Manganese Deficiency (Mn)
**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on new growth; distinct yellow mottling pattern with random brown spots
**Most Common Cause:** High pH (above 6.5 in coco/hydro)
**Fix:** Adjust pH; ensure complete micronutrient supplementation

### Zinc Deficiency (Zn)
**Symptoms:** New leaves with yellow interveinal patterning; smaller-than-normal new growth; "rosette" growth (nodes very close together, stunted)
**Fix:** pH correction; micronutrient supplement

## Toxicities

### Nitrogen Toxicity (N Tox)
**Symptoms:** Dark, shiny, waxy leaves. The tips and blades of the leaves curve sharply downward — the distinctive "nitrogen claw." Single-blade curl (one claw on each leaf tip, not the whole leaf curling).
**Fix:**
- Reduce or eliminate Grow component in base nutrients
- Flush lightly to remove excess N
- Normal in the transition from veg to flower — lower N as soon as you flip

### Nutrient Burn (General)
**Symptoms:** Brown crispy tips on otherwise healthy-looking leaves; tips progress to edges
**Fix:**
- Reduce EC by 20–30%
- Flush lightly with plain pH water
- Resume feeding at reduced dose

### Overwatering (Not a Nutrient Issue)
**Symptoms:** Drooping, "sad" leaves that point downward from the entire leaf (not just tips). The entire plant may look wilted even though the soil is wet. Yellowing may follow if chronic.
**Fix:**
- Let medium dry completely before next watering
- Check that drainage holes are clear
- Switch to smaller watering volume, more frequent cycles (better than large, infrequent)

## Environmental Disorders

### Heat Stress
**Symptoms:** Leaves curling upward like a "taco" or "canoe"; bleaching/yellowing of upper canopy. May see clawing (similar to N tox but more extreme)
**Fix:** Improve ventilation; raise light; reduce temperature

### Light Burn
**Symptoms:** Bleached white/yellow at the very top of the canopy; leaves directly under the light show whitening regardless of yellowing pattern
**Fix:** Raise light; reduce intensity; this is not a nutrient issue

### Root Bound
**Symptoms:** Plant appears to stop growing, yellows rapidly, wilts easily despite correct watering
**Fix:** Transplant to larger container immediately
