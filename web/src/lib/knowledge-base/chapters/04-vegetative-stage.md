# Chapter 4: Vegetative Stage

## Overview

The vegetative stage is when your plant builds its structure — the framework that will support your flower yield. This is the time to train aggressively, feed heavily, and establish a wide, flat canopy that maximizes light coverage.

**Duration:** 4–8 weeks for most photoperiod strains. You control the length by keeping plants on 18/6 light schedule.

**Goal:** Build a wide, multi-topped canopy with 8–16+ main colas, all at equal height.

## Environmental Targets

| Parameter | Target |
|---|---|
| Temperature (lights on) | 75–82°F |
| Temperature (lights off) | 65–72°F |
| Relative Humidity | 60–70% |
| VPD | 0.8–1.1 kPa |
| PPFD (LED) | 400–700 µmol/m²/s |
| CO2 | 400–800 ppm (ambient) |
| Light Schedule | 18 hours on / 6 hours off |

## Nutrient Requirements in Veg

Vegetative plants are heavy Nitrogen (N) feeders. They also need Phosphorus (P) for roots and Potassium (K) for overall health.

### Advanced Nutrients Veg Feeding Schedule (per gallon)
- Micro: 4 mL/gal
- Grow: 4 mL/gal
- Bloom: 4 mL/gal (equal parts)
- B-52: 2 mL/gal (B vitamin complex — stress resistance)
- Voodoo Juice: 2 mL/gal (weeks 1–3 of veg for root development)
- Big Bud: Not yet — begins in early flower

**Target EC:** 1.2–2.0 for established veg plants
**pH:** 5.8–6.2 (coco/hydro) or 6.2–6.8 (soil)

## Training Techniques for Veg

### Topping
Cut the main growing tip above the 4th or 5th node. This creates two main colas from one.
- First top: at 4–5 nodes (approximately week 3–4 of veg)
- Second top (optional): 7–10 days after first top once growth resumes
- Result: Exponential increase in bud sites

### Low Stress Training (LST)
Bend and tie stems outward to create a flat, wide canopy. Use soft plant ties or LST clips.
- Start when the plant is pliable and young
- Tie main stem and branches downward and outward
- Reposition daily as the plant grows toward the light

### Screen of Green (SCROG)
Install a trellis net above your canopy. Weave branches through the net as they grow.
- Creates a perfectly flat canopy
- Maximum light penetration to all bud sites
- Works best with 1–4 plants per 4x4 tent

## Dr. Pesos Defoliation Schedule — Vegetative Phase

Dr. Pesos' signature defoliation protocol for vegetative plants:
- **Defoliate every other week** during active vegetative growth
- Remove large fan leaves that are blocking light from lower bud sites
- Remove no more than 20–30% of leaf mass at each session
- Never defoliate a plant that is stressed, sick, or showing deficiencies
- Allow 48–72 hours of recovery before any other stressful procedure

**Why defoliate in veg?** Removing fan leaves that block light penetration redirects energy to bud sites and improves air circulation at lower canopy levels, reducing mold risk in flower.

## When to Flip to Flower

Flip from 18/6 to 12/12 light schedule when:
- Plants are approximately 50% of your desired final height (they will roughly double during flower stretch)
- Your canopy covers 70–80% of your grow space
- The plant has been trained and topped to produce your desired number of colas
- You are satisfied with the root mass and overall structure

**Typical flip height for a 4x4 tent:** 18–24 inches before flip → 36–48 inches at harvest

## Autoflower Veg Differences

Autoflowers do not have a true vegetative stage in the traditional sense — they flower based on age, not light cycle. They spend roughly 3–4 weeks in a vegetative-like growth phase before automatically initiating flower.

- **Do NOT top autoflowers** unless you are experienced — the recovery time eats into their short life cycle
- **Gentle LST only** — bend, don't cut
- **Light schedule:** Keep at 20/4 or 18/6 throughout the entire grow
