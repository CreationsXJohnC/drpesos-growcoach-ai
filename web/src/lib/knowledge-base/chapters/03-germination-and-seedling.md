# Chapter 3: Germination & Seedling Stage

## Germination Methods

### Paper Towel Method (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Dampen two paper towels with pH-adjusted water (6.0–6.5)
2. Place seeds between the towels
3. Store in a warm, dark place (75–80°F) — a plate with another plate on top works well
4. Check daily; most seeds crack and show a taproot within 24–72 hours
5. Transplant once the taproot is 0.25–0.5 inches long
6. Handle with clean tweezers only — never touch the taproot with bare hands

### Direct Sow Method
1. Pre-soak seeds in pH-adjusted water for 12–24 hours
2. Plant 0.25–0.5 inches deep in moist (not wet) medium
3. Cover lightly; keep warm and humid
4. Germination takes 3–7 days

### Starter Cubes (Rockwool or Rapid Rooter)
1. Pre-soak cubes in pH 5.5–6.0 water
2. Place one seed per cube, pointed end down
3. Keep cubes moist but not waterlogged
4. Place in a humidity dome at 75–80°F
5. Seedlings appear in 3–5 days

## The Seedling Stage (Days 1–21)

After germination, the seedling stage begins. This is the most fragile period — the root system is tiny and the plant cannot handle stress.

### Environmental Targets
- Temperature: 75–80°F
- Humidity: 65–75% (high humidity supports leaf transpiration before roots are established)
- Light intensity: 200–300 µmol/m²/s (keep LED high, reduce to avoid light stress)
- Light schedule: 18/6 (photoperiod strains) or 20/4 (autoflowers)

### Watering Seedlings
- Use a spray bottle or gentle watering can with a fine rose head
- Water in a small circle around the stem — this encourages roots to reach outward
- The soil/coco should be moist, not wet
- Allow the medium to dry slightly between waterings
- **Never let seedlings sit in standing water**

### Nutrient Needs in Seedling Stage
- Plain water or very low concentration nutrients for the first 1–2 weeks
- If using a pre-amended soil (like Fox Farm Ocean Forest), no additional nutrients are needed for 3–4 weeks
- If using coco from day 1, begin at 25% nutrient dose with CalMag

### What to Look For
**Healthy seedling signs:**
- Bright green cotyledons (seed leaves) and first true leaves
- Sturdy, upright stem
- Leaves pointing upward (praying)

**Problem signs:**
- Pale yellow cotyledons → nitrogen deficiency or pH lockout
- Stretched/tall, falling over (etiolation) → light is too far away or too dim
- Curling, brown tips → overwatering or nutrient burn
- Damping off (stem rotting at soil line) → too much moisture, poor airflow

## Transplanting Seedlings

Transplant from starter cubes or solo cups to final containers when:
- The seedling's roots have filled the current container (visible from bottom drainage holes)
- The seedling has 4–6 sets of leaves and is visibly robust
- Typically 2–3 weeks after germination

### Transplant Protocol
1. Water the current container 1–2 hours before transplanting to bind the root ball
2. Prepare the new container with moist medium (dig a hole sized to the current root ball)
3. Gently remove the seedling — squeeze flexible containers to loosen
4. Place root ball in the new hole; the stem should be at the same depth as before (or slightly deeper for leggy seedlings)
5. Backfill gently; do not compact the medium
6. Water with plain pH-adjusted water + a small dose of rooting enzyme (e.g., Advanced Nutrients Voodoo Juice)

**Note on autoflowers:** Autoflowers do NOT respond well to transplanting due to their time-sensitive nature. Start them directly in their final container (3–5 gallon fabric pots).
