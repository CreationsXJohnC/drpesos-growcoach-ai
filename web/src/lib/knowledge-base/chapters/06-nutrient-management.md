# Chapter 6: Nutrient Management

## The Big Three: N-P-K

All plants need three macronutrients in large amounts:
- **Nitrogen (N):** Leaf and stem growth, chlorophyll production. High demand in veg, reduced in flower.
- **Phosphorus (P):** Root development, flower formation, energy transfer. High demand from flower onset.
- **Potassium (K):** Overall plant health, water regulation, terpene and trichome production. High demand throughout flower.

## Secondary Nutrients
- **Calcium (Ca):** Cell wall structure, prevents tip burn and root development issues
- **Magnesium (Mg):** Center of chlorophyll molecule; deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between leaf veins)
- **Sulfur (S):** Enzyme function, terpene synthesis

## Micronutrients (Trace Elements)
Iron, Manganese, Zinc, Boron, Copper, Molybdenum — needed in small amounts but critical for enzyme function. Most quality base nutrients include these.

## pH and Nutrient Lockout

Nutrients are only available to plants within certain pH ranges. Incorrect pH causes "lockout" — nutrients are present but the plant cannot absorb them.

### Nutrient Availability Chart by pH (Soil)
- pH 6.0–6.5: Maximum availability for most nutrients
- Below 5.5: Iron and manganese toxicity; calcium and magnesium locked out
- Above 7.0: Iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron all become unavailable

### Nutrient Availability (Coco/Hydro)
- Optimal range: 5.8–6.2
- Wider acceptable range: 5.5–6.5

## Advanced Nutrients Product Line Overview

Dr. Pesos recommends Advanced Nutrients (AN) for its pH Perfect technology and comprehensive product range.

### pH Perfect Base Nutrients
**Grow-Micro-Bloom (GMB)** — The foundation of every AN grow
- Equal parts (4-4-4 mL per gallon) during veg
- Shift to (2-4-6) ratio during flower
- pH Perfect technology automatically buffers pH to 5.5–6.5 range

### Performance Enhancers
| Product | Stage | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Voodoo Juice | Weeks 1–5 (root zone) | Beneficial microbes, root mass |
| B-52 | All stages | B vitamins, stress resistance, growth |
| Big Bud | Weeks 1–4 of flower | Phosphorus/potassium boost, bud swelling |
| Overdrive | Weeks 5–7 of flower | Late-stage bud hardening and weight |
| Flawless Finish | Final 7–14 days | Flush aid, removes excess salts |
| Rhino Skin | Weeks 3–7 | Silicon for stem strength and mold resistance |
| Bud Candy | Weeks 1–5 of flower | Carbohydrates, terpene and aroma enhancement |
| Sensi Cal-Mag Xtra | When needed | Calcium-Magnesium supplement, for coco/hydro |

## Organic vs. Salt-Based Nutrients

### Salt-Based (Synthetic)
- Fast-acting, precise control
- Higher risk of burn; must flush between cycles
- pH management more critical
- Best for coco and hydro

### Organic
- Slower acting but more forgiving
- Improves soil microbial life
- Lower burn risk
- Harder to correct deficiencies quickly
- Best for living soil and organic grows

## Feeding Schedule Strategy

### Ramp Up, Peak, Taper
Never go from zero to full strength immediately. Introduce nutrients gradually:
1. Start at 25–50% of recommended dose
2. Increase 10–20% per week as plants respond positively
3. Peak doses in weeks 4–6 of flower
4. Taper off and flush for final 7–14 days

### Watering Frequency and Feeding Frequency
- **Coco:** Water daily with full nutrient solution (no plain water days)
- **Soil:** Alternate between nutrient feeds and plain pH water (every other watering)
- **Hydro:** Recirculating systems with constant EC maintenance; top-off with fresh solution daily

## Signs of Nutrient Problems

### Deficiencies
- **Nitrogen deficiency:** Yellowing starting from lower/older leaves, working upward. Leaves yellow uniformly.
- **Phosphorus deficiency:** Purpling/reddening of stems and undersides of leaves, dark green leaves
- **Potassium deficiency:** Brown scorching on leaf tips and edges, starting with older leaves
- **Calcium deficiency:** Brown spots on new growth, leaves cupping upward, tip burn on leaves
- **Magnesium deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellow between veins, veins remain green) on mid-age leaves
- **Iron deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis on new growth (youngest leaves affected first)

### Toxicities
- **Nitrogen toxicity:** Dark green, extremely waxy leaves. Leaves "clawing" downward (nitrogen claw). Single-tip curl under.
- **Nutrient burn:** Brown crispy tips, usually from excessive EC

## Flush Protocol

Flushing removes salt buildup from the root zone and medium.

### When to Flush
- Final flush before harvest: 7–14 days before chop
- Mid-grow reset: If salt buildup is causing lockout (runoff EC 3x higher than input EC)

### How to Flush (Soil/Coco)
1. Run plain pH-adjusted water through the medium (2–3x the pot volume)
2. Measure input EC and runoff EC
3. Continue until runoff EC is within 200–400 ppm of input
4. In final flush: add Flawless Finish at 2 mL/gal for first half, then plain water only

### Hydroponic Flush
- Drain reservoir, rinse with plain water
- Refill with very low EC solution (200–400 ppm with Flawless Finish)
- Run for 7–14 days before harvest
