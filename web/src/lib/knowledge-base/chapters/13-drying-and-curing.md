# Chapter 13: Drying & Curing — Protecting Your Harvest

## Why Drying and Curing Matter

Drying and curing are the most overlooked stages of cannabis cultivation — and the most commonly rushed. A well-grown plant that is dried and cured improperly produces harsh, less potent, poorly flavored product. A perfectly dried and cured harvest can be significantly more potent, aromatic, and smooth than the same plant dried incorrectly.

**The science:** During the curing process, enzymes and bacteria break down chlorophyll, sugars, and starches that would otherwise make the smoke harsh. Terpenes develop and evolve. Cannabinoid conversion continues even after harvest.

## The Drying Stage

### Target Conditions
- **Temperature:** 60–65°F
- **Relative Humidity:** 55–62%
- **Airflow:** Gentle, indirect airflow. Never point a fan directly at drying buds.
- **Darkness:** Total darkness — light degrades cannabinoids and terpenes
- **Duration:** 10–14 days (do not rush; this is the baseline for quality)

### Signs That Drying is Complete
- Small branches snap cleanly when bent (do not bend; just snap)
- Larger stems still flex slightly — that's normal
- Buds feel dry to the touch but not crumbly
- No moisture visible when you squeeze a bud

### Slow is Better
The ideal dry is slow. A 10–14 day dry is significantly better than a 5–7 day dry:
- More chlorophyll breaks down
- Terpenes have time to develop and settle
- The resulting smoke is smoother and more aromatic

**If your drying environment is too dry (below 45% RH):** Buds will dry in 3–5 days, locking in harshness and reducing aroma. Use a humidifier or seal the drying room more tightly.

**If too humid (above 65% RH):** Mold risk increases dramatically. Use a dehumidifier and increase gentle airflow.

## The Curing Stage

### Setup
- Use glass mason jars (wide-mouth preferred)
- Fill jars 75–80% full — buds need room to breathe
- Never pack jars tightly
- Store in cool (60–65°F), dark location (box, cabinet, or dedicated curing refrigerator)

### The Burping Protocol
For the first 2 weeks: open jars daily for 15–30 minutes to exchange gases. This allows:
- Residual moisture to escape evenly
- Fresh oxygen into the jar
- CO2 and ethylene to exhaust

If you smell ammonia when opening a jar: the buds were jarred too wet. Leave the lid off for several hours; if the smell persists, spread buds out for 4–8 hours before re-jarring.

### Curing Timeline

| Period | Action | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Days 1–7 | Open daily; 15–30 min | Moisture equalization |
| Days 7–14 | Open daily; 15–30 min | Chlorophyll breakdown continues |
| Weeks 2–4 | Open every 2–3 days | Terpene development; aroma improves |
| Weeks 4–8 | Open once a week | Flavor deepens; smoothness increases |
| Weeks 8+ | Open monthly if long-term storing | Full cure; peak quality achieved |

**Minimum cure for quality product:** 4 weeks
**Optimal cure for premium product:** 6–8 weeks
**Long-term storage:** 3–6+ months in an airtight, humidity-controlled jar

### Target Jar Humidity
Use a small hygrometer or Boveda humidity pack inside each jar:
- **Ideal jar RH:** 58–62%
- Below 55%: Add a Boveda 62 pack to raise humidity
- Above 65%: Remove pack; burp longer each session

## Common Drying & Curing Mistakes

**Drying too fast:** Harsh, grassy-tasting product. Remedy: burp jars frequently in first weeks; cure longer.

**Jarring too wet:** Ammonia smell; high mold risk. Remedy: immediately spread buds to dry more; re-jar when target moisture is reached.

**Jarring too dry:** Low moisture, reduced potency/aroma. Hard to fix but Boveda packs can help restore some moisture over time.

**Too much heat during drying:** Above 70°F causes terpene evaporation. The smell fills your drying room but not your jars. Irreversible.

**Light exposure:** UV degrades THC into CBN. Always dry and cure in darkness.

## Long-Term Storage

For product stored beyond 8 weeks:
- Keep at 55–60°F (wine refrigerator is ideal)
- Humidity: 58–62% with Boveda packs
- Glass jars only — no plastic bags
- Avoid freezing unless using for extraction (freezing breaks trichomes)
- Properly cured and stored cannabis maintains quality for 1–2 years

## Trimming After Dry (Dry Trim Method)

If you dry trimmed (recommended):
1. Work over a clean trimming tray with a screen to collect kief
2. Use sharp scissors — clean every 30 minutes with ISO alcohol
3. Remove remaining sugar leaves (those with visible trichomes are trim/shake; those without are discard)
4. Target: tight, manicured buds with sugar leaves trimmed flush to the bud surface
5. Collect all trim for hash, oil, or edible production
