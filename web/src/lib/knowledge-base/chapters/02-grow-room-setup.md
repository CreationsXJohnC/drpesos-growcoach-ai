# Chapter 2: Grow Room Setup & Equipment

## Choosing Your Space

The ideal grow space is light-sealed, well-ventilated, and easy to clean. Common options:

- **Grow tent** — Best for most home growers. Reflective interior, easy setup, 2x2 to 10x10 ft available.
- **Dedicated closet or room** — Paint walls flat white or use Mylar. Seal gaps with weather stripping.
- **Converted shed or garage** — Good for larger grows; requires proper insulation and climate control.

**Rule of thumb:** Calculate your tent/room footprint from your light coverage. A 4x4 ft space works well with a single 600W HPS or 600W+ LED.

## Ventilation & Air Exchange

Proper airflow prevents heat buildup, removes humidity, refreshes CO2, and prevents mold.

### Ventilation Formula
Aim for **one complete air exchange per minute** in your grow space.

- Calculate cubic feet: Length × Width × Height
- Example: 4x4x7 ft tent = 112 cubic feet → use a 110–150 CFM inline fan

### Setup
1. **Intake:** Passive intake at the bottom (fresh air in)
2. **Exhaust:** Inline fan pulling air out through a carbon filter (top of tent, where heat rises)
3. **Oscillating fan:** Inside the tent for stem strengthening and canopy movement
4. **Carbon filter:** Rated for at least 110% of your fan CFM for odor control

## Temperature & Humidity Targets by Stage

| Stage | Temp (°F) | RH | VPD |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seedling | 75–80°F | 65–70% | 0.5–0.8 kPa |
| Vegetative | 75–82°F | 60–70% | 0.8–1.1 kPa |
| Early Flower (wks 1–4) | 72–80°F | 50–60% | 1.0–1.3 kPa |
| Late Flower (wks 5+) | 68–76°F | 40–50% | 1.3–1.5 kPa |
| Drying | 60–65°F | 55–62% | N/A |

**Day/Night differential:** A 5–10°F drop at lights-off is beneficial, especially during late flower. Avoid drops greater than 15°F to prevent mold.

## Lighting Setup

Position your light at the manufacturer's recommended height. General guidelines:

- **LED (Full Spectrum):** 18–24" above canopy during veg; 12–18" during flower
- **HPS 600W:** 18–24" above canopy
- **CMH 315W:** 12–18" above canopy

Use a PAR/PPFD meter to dial in light intensity:
- Seedling: 200–400 µmol/m²/s
- Vegetative: 400–600 µmol/m²/s
- Flowering: 600–900+ µmol/m²/s

## Water Quality & pH

### pH Targets by Medium
- **Soil:** 6.0–7.0 (ideal: 6.2–6.8)
- **Coco coir:** 5.5–6.5 (ideal: 5.8–6.2)
- **Hydroponics/Rockwool:** 5.5–6.5 (ideal: 5.8–6.0)

Always pH your water AFTER adding nutrients. pH fluctuation locks out specific nutrients.

### EC/PPM Guidelines
- Seedling: 200–400 ppm (0.4–0.8 EC)
- Vegetative: 400–800 ppm (0.8–1.6 EC)
- Early Flower: 800–1200 ppm (1.6–2.4 EC)
- Late Flower: 600–1000 ppm (1.2–2.0 EC, start tapering)
- Flush: 0–200 ppm (water only + flushing agent)

## Grow Room Sanitation

Clean grows produce clean product. Between grows:
- Wipe down tent walls with diluted hydrogen peroxide (3%)
- Replace any substrate (soil/coco)
- Sterilize reusable containers
- Check for pest eggs or mold in hidden corners
- Inspect fans and filters for dust buildup
