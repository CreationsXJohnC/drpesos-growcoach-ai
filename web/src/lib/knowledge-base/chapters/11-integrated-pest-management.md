# Chapter 11: Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

## The IPM Philosophy

Integrated Pest Management is a systematic, preventive approach to pest control. The goal is not to eliminate every organism in your grow room, but to maintain populations of harmful organisms below economically or qualitatively damaging thresholds — using the least disruptive, safest methods available.

The hierarchy of IPM:
1. **Prevention** (first and most important)
2. **Cultural controls** (sanitation, airflow, plant health)
3. **Physical controls** (sticky traps, physical removal)
4. **Biological controls** (beneficial insects)
5. **Chemical controls** (last resort; organic preferred)

## Prevention — The Dr. Pesos IPM Standard

Prevention is 90% of IPM. Follow these protocols every grow:
- Change clothes before entering the grow room
- Wash hands before handling plants
- Keep pets out of grow spaces
- Quarantine all new plants for 2 weeks before introducing to your grow room
- Inspect all growing medium for pests before use
- Clean all tools with diluted hydrogen peroxide (3%) between uses
- Empty plant saucers after watering to eliminate breeding grounds
- Install a HEPA air filter on your intake to reduce airborne spores and pests

## Scouting Protocol

Proactive weekly scouting is non-negotiable. Spend 10–15 minutes per week:
- Inspect the undersides of leaves (where most pests live and lay eggs)
- Look for webbing, spots, frass (pest droppings), or egg clusters
- Check for sticky residue (honeydew from aphids/whiteflies)
- Use a 30x loupe to see spider mites, eggs, and early-stage damage

## Common Pests and Treatment

### Spider Mites (Tetranychus urticae)
**Identification:** Tiny dots on leaves (stippling), fine webbing on undersides and between stems. Under a loupe: small 8-legged orange/red/white specks.
**Conditions that favor:** Hot, dry, low humidity environments
**Prevention:** Maintain 50–60% RH; do not let temperature exceed 85°F
**Treatment:**
- Early: Neem oil spray (4 tsp/gal + 1 tsp dish soap) or insecticidal soap; treat weekly for 3 weeks
- Moderate: Spinosad (Monterey Garden Insect Spray) or Avid (commercial)
- Severe: Remove heavily infested plants; treat remaining aggressively

### Fungus Gnats (Bradysia spp.)
**Identification:** Small black flies (adult) hovering around soil surface. Larvae are clear/white with black heads in top inch of soil.
**Conditions that favor:** Consistently wet/moist topsoil
**Prevention:** Allow top inch of soil to dry between waterings; avoid overwatering
**Treatment:**
- Yellow sticky traps at soil level (trap adults)
- Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTi) — Gnatrol or Mosquito Dunks in water to kill larvae
- Diatomaceous earth (DE) as top dressing — kills larvae on contact
- Beneficial nematodes: Steinernema feltiae — applied to soil, parasitizes larvae

### Aphids
**Identification:** Clusters of soft-bodied insects (green, black, white) on new growth and undersides of leaves. Honeydew (sticky residue) on leaves below infested areas.
**Prevention:** Inspect new clones; companion planting (basil repels aphids)
**Treatment:**
- Remove by hand or with strong water spray
- Insecticidal soap spray every 3–4 days
- Neem oil spray
- Beneficial insects: Ladybugs (Hippodamia convergens), parasitic wasps

### Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis)
**Identification:** Silver/bronze streaks on leaves; tiny yellow or black insects. Leaves look scarred, silvery, or stippled.
**Prevention:** Sticky yellow/blue traps; quarantine incoming plants
**Treatment:**
- Spinosad (most effective organic treatment)
- Neem oil
- Diatomaceous earth as a top dressing

### Whitefly
**Identification:** Tiny white flying insects on underside of leaves; clouds of white insects when plants are disturbed
**Treatment:**
- Yellow sticky traps
- Insecticidal soap
- Spinosad
- Encarsia formosa (beneficial parasitic wasp) — biological control

### Root Aphids
One of the most damaging and difficult-to-treat pests. Live in the root zone; visible as white specks on roots.
**Treatment:**
- Beneficial nematodes
- Pyrethrin soil drench (organic extract from chrysanthemum flowers)
- In severe cases: discontinue affected grow; sterilize all equipment

## Common Diseases

### Powdery Mildew (PM)
**Identification:** White, powdery spots or coating on leaves, typically starting on upper leaf surface
**Conditions that favor:** High humidity, poor airflow, temps below 72°F, crowded canopy
**Prevention:** Maintain VPD targets; ensure adequate airflow; defoliate for air circulation; avoid leaf-to-leaf contact
**Treatment:**
- Potassium bicarbonate (Milstop) — very effective organic treatment
- 3% hydrogen peroxide spray
- UV-C light (commercial)
- Remove heavily infected leaves immediately
- DO NOT use PM-infected plants for clones — cut your losses

### Botrytis (Gray Mold / Bud Rot)
**Identification:** Gray, fuzzy mold inside dense buds; internal rotting; visible gray spores
**Conditions that favor:** High humidity (>55% in flower), poor airflow, damaged plant tissue
**Prevention:** Keep RH below 50% in late flower; ensure excellent airflow through canopy; handle plants carefully to avoid bruising
**Treatment:**
- Immediately remove all infected material
- Reduce humidity aggressively
- Increase airflow
- Spray surrounding healthy plants with 3% H2O2
- There is NO cure for bud rot — prevention is everything

### Root Rot (Pythium)
**Identification:** Brown, slimy roots (healthy roots should be white); wilting despite adequate water; foul smell from reservoir
**Conditions that favor:** High water temperatures (above 72°F), low oxygen in root zone, overwatering
**Prevention:** Keep reservoir at 65–70°F; use air pumps; don't overwater; use beneficial bacteria (Voodoo Juice)
**Treatment:**
- Beneficial bacteria and mycorrhizae (Great White, Hydroguard)
- Reduce reservoir temperature with a chiller
- Hydrogen peroxide (3%) flush — kills pathogens but also beneficial organisms

## Spray Schedule Template

| Week | Treatment | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 of veg | Neem oil preventive | Foliar spray |
| Week 2 of veg | Skip |  |
| Week 3 of veg | Neem oil or insecticidal soap | Foliar spray |
| Week 1 of flower | Final foliar spray (last chance) | Foliar spray |
| Weeks 2–8 of flower | NO spraying on buds | Root drenches only if needed |

**Critical:** Never spray buds with any substance. Residue can trap moisture (mold risk), contaminate the final product, and affect taste/aroma. All foliar sprays must be completed before buds form, or earlier than week 2 of flower.
