# Chapter 16: Advanced Techniques — CO2, RDWC, Living Soil, and Beyond

## Introduction to Advanced Growing

Once you've mastered the fundamentals — consistent environment, proper nutrition, training, and pest management — advanced techniques can push your results further. But these techniques amplify both results and problems: a skill issue that produces a minor deficiency in a basic setup can cause a total crop failure in a complex one.

**Prerequisites before advanced techniques:**
- Multiple successful grows with consistent results
- Strong grasp of VPD, pH, EC management
- Understanding of the plant's stress responses
- Reliable, stable environmental control

## CO2 Supplementation

### Overview
Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis. At ambient levels (400 ppm), cannabis photosynthesis is limited more by CO2 availability than light or nutrients at high PPFD levels. Supplementing CO2 to 1000–1500 ppm can increase photosynthesis rates by 20–30%.

### Requirements for CO2 to Work
CO2 supplementation ONLY produces results when:
1. PPFD is above 800 µmol/m²/s (plants need light to use extra CO2)
2. Room is sealed (exhaust fans off; CO2 would escape in open rooms)
3. Temperature is warm: 80–85°F (high CO2 allows higher temps)
4. Nutrition is dialed in (faster growth requires more nutrients)

### CO2 Systems
**Tanks + regulator + controller (recommended):**
- Precise, controllable, no combustion byproducts
- CO2 controller with sensor automatically opens/closes valve to maintain target ppm
- Costs: $300–600 for equipment + tank refills

**CO2 burner (propane/natural gas):**
- More common in large commercial spaces
- Produces CO2 + heat + humidity — all must be managed
- Requires proper ventilation for safety

### CO2 Delivery
- Release CO2 during lights-on period only (plants don't photosynthesize in dark)
- Release above the canopy (CO2 is heavier than air; will sink down)
- Maintain 1000–1500 ppm for maximum benefit (higher yields diminishing returns)

## Recirculating Deep Water Culture (RDWC)

### Overview
RDWC is the commercial-scale evolution of standard DWC. Multiple plant buckets are connected to a central reservoir with a pump recirculating oxygenated nutrient solution continuously.

### RDWC Advantages Over Standard DWC
- Larger nutrient volume = more stable pH and EC
- Easier maintenance (adjust nutrients in central reservoir, not individual buckets)
- More consistent nutrient delivery across all plants
- Scalable to large commercial systems

### RDWC Setup Components
- Central reservoir (40–100+ gallons depending on scale)
- Individual bucket sites (6" net pot diameter, one plant each)
- Water pump: recirculates solution from reservoir to buckets
- Air pump + airstones in each bucket and reservoir
- Water chiller (65–70°F is critical to prevent root rot)
- CO2 and sealed environment (at this investment level, CO2 is worthwhile)

### Management
- Check EC and pH twice daily; adjust in central reservoir
- Change full reservoir every 7–10 days; clean between grows
- Use beneficial bacteria (Hydroguard) continuously to prevent root pathogens
- Keep roots healthy: white roots = healthy; brown/slimy = root rot in progress

## Living Soil

### Overview
Living soil takes an ecological approach: instead of feeding the plant nutrients directly, you feed the organisms in the soil, which in turn make nutrients available to plants in plant-usable form. This mimics natural soil ecosystems.

### Key Components
- **Mycorrhizal fungi:** Extend root surface area by hundreds of times; help plants access phosphorus and water
- **Bacterial colonies:** Break down organic matter into plant-available nutrients; fix atmospheric nitrogen
- **Predatory nematodes:** Keep pest populations in check
- **Earthworms:** Aerate soil and produce castings (the ultimate slow-release fertilizer)

### Building Living Soil (Base Recipe)
- 1/3 high-quality compost (worm castings, mushroom compost)
- 1/3 perlite or pumice (aeration)
- 1/3 sphagnum peat moss or coco coir (water retention)
- Amendments: blood meal, bone meal, kelp meal, oyster shell, basalt rock dust, biochar

### Managing Living Soil
- Water with plain pH-adjusted water (6.2–6.8) or dechlorinated water
- Use compost teas to boost microbial activity
- Top dress with worm castings between waterings
- **Do NOT** pH-adjust water excessively — the living organisms buffer pH naturally
- **Do NOT** use salt-based synthetic nutrients — they kill soil life

### Strengths and Limitations
✓ Best flavor and terpene profiles
✓ Natural pest resistance (healthy soil = healthy plants = natural defenses)
✓ Lower ongoing input costs (after initial setup)
✓ No nutrient-lockout issues (the biology manages nutrient availability)
✗ Cannot correct problems quickly
✗ Requires significant setup knowledge and investment
✗ Not suitable for high-intensity commercial production

## Aeroponics

### Overview
Plant roots hang in air and are misted with fine droplets of nutrient solution. The highest oxygen-to-water ratio of any growing method → fastest growth and highest yield potential.

### Commercial Aeroponics
- High-pressure aeroponics (HPA): Mist droplets <50 microns; true aeroponics
- Low-pressure aeroponics: Larger droplets; easier to maintain but lower performance
- Used commercially by large operations maximizing space efficiency

### Challenges
- Most technically demanding system to build and maintain
- Pump/mister failures are immediately life-threatening to plants
- Clogging is common with mineral nutrients — organic nutrients essential
- Requires backup power for any serious operation

## Photoperiod Light Manipulation

### Dep (Light Deprivation) Outdoors
Covers outdoor plants during the day to simulate the 12/12 photoperiod artificially — allows multiple harvests per year outdoors or early harvests before fall.

### Speed Growing Techniques Indoors
- **9/15 schedule:** 9 hours light / 15 hours dark → faster flower maturation (especially for sativa/long-flowering strains)
- **Darkness periods:** Extended dark period at end of flower to encourage final trichome development

## Tissue Culture and Genetic Preservation

For breeders and commercial operations preserving elite genetics:
- Tissue culture maintains mother plants in sterile, disease-free conditions
- Infinite clones from minimal plant material
- Long-term storage of genetics in lab conditions
- Standard practice in high-end commercial operations and breeding programs
