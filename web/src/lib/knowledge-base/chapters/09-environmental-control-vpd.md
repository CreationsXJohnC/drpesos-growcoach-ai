# Chapter 9: Environmental Control — Temperature, Humidity & VPD

## Why Environment is the Foundation

You can have the best genetics, nutrients, and lighting — but if your environment is wrong, nothing works at its potential. Temperature and humidity affect every aspect of plant biology: transpiration, stomata function, nutrient uptake, photosynthesis rate, and disease susceptibility.

## Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)

VPD is the single most important environmental metric. It measures the "thirst" of the air — the difference between the moisture the air currently holds and the maximum moisture it could hold at that temperature.

### Why VPD Matters
Plants regulate water uptake through transpiration (water vapor leaving through leaf stomata). When VPD is in the correct range:
- Stomata open fully → CO2 enters freely → faster photosynthesis
- Water and nutrients are pulled through the root zone efficiently
- Transpiration creates a natural cooling effect

When VPD is too low (high humidity):
- Stomata partially close → CO2 uptake reduced → slower growth
- Risk of mold, powdery mildew, botrytis

When VPD is too high (low humidity or high temps):
- Stomata close completely to prevent water loss
- Growth stops; plant goes into stress
- Risk of heat stress, nutrient toxicity (less dilution of salts)

## VPD Targets by Stage

| Stage | VPD Target (kPa) | Typical Temp (°F) | Typical RH (%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clone/Seedling | 0.4–0.8 kPa | 75–80°F | 70–80% |
| Early Veg | 0.8–1.0 kPa | 76–82°F | 65–70% |
| Late Veg | 0.9–1.1 kPa | 76–82°F | 60–65% |
| Early Flower | 1.0–1.3 kPa | 74–80°F | 55–60% |
| Mid-Late Flower | 1.3–1.5 kPa | 70–76°F | 45–55% |
| Final Weeks | 1.2–1.5 kPa | 68–74°F | 40–50% |

Note: These are leaf surface temperature targets. Leaf temperature is typically 2–4°F below air temperature. High-end growers use an infrared thermometer to measure actual leaf temp for even more precise VPD calculation.

## How to Calculate VPD

VPD = Saturation vapor pressure at leaf temp − Actual vapor pressure at air conditions

**Practical approach:** Use a VPD chart (widely available online). Cross-reference your current temperature and humidity to find your VPD value.

## Temperature Control

### Heating
- Seedling/early veg: Small ceramic heaters or heat mats
- Established plants rarely need heating if lights are running
- Minimum temperature: Never let plants go below 60°F; growth significantly slows below 65°F

### Cooling
- **Inline fan + ventilation** — Primary cooling method; remove hot air from your space
- **Air conditioner (mini-split)** — For large spaces or hot climates
- **Air-cooled hoods** — Remove heat directly from HPS fixtures

### Avoiding Temperature Fluctuations
Large swings between lights-on and lights-off temperature (>15°F) cause:
- Excess moisture condensation → mold risk
- Stress responses → reduced growth and yield

Target day/night differential: 5–10°F

## Humidity Control

### Raising Humidity
- Humidifier (ultrasonic preferred for clean mist)
- Wet towels or trays of water (temporary fix)
- Reduce ventilation slightly (careful — don't compromise CO2)

### Lowering Humidity
- Dehumidifier — Essential for late flower
- Increase ventilation/airflow
- Space plants further apart to improve airflow
- Remove standing water from trays promptly after watering

### Dehumidifier Sizing
Calculate room volume (cubic feet) and select a dehumidifier rated for at least that volume. For a 4x4x7 ft tent (112 cubic ft ≈ 840 liters): a 20–30 pint/day dehumidifier is sufficient.

## CO2 Supplementation

Plants use CO2 during photosynthesis. Ambient CO2 is ~400 ppm. At high PPFD levels (800+ µmol/m²/s), plants can use elevated CO2 levels.

### CO2 Levels
- **Ambient (400 ppm):** Normal results
- **800–1000 ppm:** Modest growth improvement; requires sealed room
- **1200–1500 ppm:** Significant growth increase with high PPFD; requires sealed room + cooling
- **Above 1500 ppm:** Diminishing returns; requires very precise control

### CO2 Methods
- **CO2 burner (propane/natural gas):** Most common for commercial; adds heat and moisture
- **CO2 tanks + regulator + controller:** Clean, precise, controllable
- **CO2 bags (mushroom-based):** Minimal effect, not reliable for serious growers

**Critical:** CO2 supplementation ONLY helps when PPFD is above 700–800 µmol/m²/s and temperature is warm (78–85°F). At lower light levels, extra CO2 does nothing.

## Monitoring Tools

Every grow should have:
- **Digital thermometer/hygrometer** with min/max memory (check daily)
- **Inline fan controller** (speed control based on temperature)
- **VPD chart** posted inside the grow space
- **Infrared thermometer** (optional but valuable for leaf temperature)
- **PAR meter** (optional; strongly recommended for dialing in light intensity)
