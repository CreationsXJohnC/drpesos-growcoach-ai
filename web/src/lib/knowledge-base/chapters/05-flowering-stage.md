# Chapter 5: Flowering Stage

## The Flip: Triggering Flower

Switch photoperiod strains from 18/6 to 12/12 light schedule to trigger flowering. The plant detects the longer dark period and begins producing buds.

**What happens at the flip:**
- Days 1–7: Plant continues vegetative growth; no visible bud sites yet
- Days 7–14: "Stretch" begins — plant may grow 25–100% taller
- Week 2–3: First white pistils emerge at bud sites; pre-flowers form
- Week 4+: Buds begin to swell and stack; trichomes begin forming
- Week 8–12+: Bud maturation; trichomes turn from clear to cloudy to amber

## Flowering Stage Timeline by Strain Type

| Strain | Typical Flower Duration |
|---|---|
| Indica | 7–9 weeks |
| Hybrid (Indica-dominant) | 8–10 weeks |
| Sativa / Sativa-dominant | 10–14 weeks |
| Autoflower (total cycle) | 10–12 weeks from seed |

## Environmental Targets

| Parameter | Early Flower (Wks 1–4) | Late Flower (Wks 5+) |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | 74–80°F | 68–76°F |
| Humidity | 50–60% | 40–50% |
| VPD | 1.0–1.3 kPa | 1.3–1.5 kPa |
| PPFD | 700–900 µmol/m²/s | 800–1000 µmol/m²/s |
| CO2 | 800–1200 ppm (supplemented) | 800–1200 ppm |
| Light Schedule | 12/12 | 12/12 |

**Late flower humidity is critical.** Above 55% RH in weeks 6+ creates ideal conditions for botrytis (bud rot). Use a dehumidifier if needed.

## Nutrient Requirements in Flower

### The PK Shift
As plants enter flower, they need less Nitrogen and more Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K).

### Advanced Nutrients Flower Feeding Schedule (per gallon)
**Weeks 1–3 (Early Flower / Stretch):**
- Micro: 4 mL/gal
- Grow: 2 mL/gal (reducing N)
- Bloom: 4 mL/gal (increasing P/K)
- Big Bud: 2 mL/gal (starts here — bud swelling)
- B-52: 2 mL/gal

**Weeks 4–6 (Bud Bulking):**
- Micro: 4 mL/gal
- Grow: 0–1 mL/gal (minimal N)
- Bloom: 5 mL/gal
- Big Bud: 4 mL/gal (peak dose)
- Overdrive: 2 mL/gal (weeks 5–6 for late-stage bud development)
- B-52: 2 mL/gal

**Weeks 7–8 (Ripening / Pre-Flush):**
- Micro: 3 mL/gal
- Bloom: 3 mL/gal
- Overdrive: 2 mL/gal
- Flawless Finish (begins week 8): 2 mL/gal

**Week 8–10 (Flush):**
- Water only + Flawless Finish or plain pH water
- Target runoff EC below 200–400 ppm

## Dr. Pesos Defoliation Schedule — Flower Phase

**Defoliation Session 1 — Early Flower (Week 2–3):**
Remove large fan leaves blocking bud sites. The plant has just stretched and has many overlapping leaves. Remove 20–30% of leaf mass. Focus on leaves blocking light from lower canopy bud sites.

**Defoliation Session 2 — Mid Flower (Week 5–6):**
Final defoliation. Remove fan leaves that are blocking bud sites or creating "pockets" that trap humidity. Do NOT defoliate after week 6 — the plant needs its leaves for energy in the final push.

**Critical rule:** No defoliation after week 6 of flower. Plants in late flower cannot recover quickly, and removing leaves reduces photosynthesis at the exact time you need maximum energy going into bud production.

## Managing the Stretch

The stretch (weeks 1–3 of flower) can be dramatic in sativa-dominant strains. Manage it:
- Supercrop any branches that grow too tall — bend the stem until you hear a slight crack, then flatten it horizontally
- Continue LST training
- If plants are too tall: lower the pot by raising it on a platform during veg, then remove the platform at flip to give vertical room

## Trichome Development Stages

Trichomes are the tiny resin glands that produce cannabinoids and terpenes. Harvest timing is based on trichome color — use a jeweler's loupe (30–60x) or digital microscope:

| Trichome Color | Stage | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Clear/translucent | Not ready | Under-developed |
| Cloudy/milky | Peak THC | Energetic, cerebral |
| Mostly cloudy with some amber (10–20%) | Harvest window | Balanced, strong |
| 30–50% amber | Over-ripe (for most) | Heavier, relaxing, more CBD-like |

**Dr. Pesos harvest recommendation:** Harvest when 70–90% cloudy with 10–20% amber for balanced, potent results. Sativa strains: harvest slightly earlier. Indica strains: can wait for more amber for deeper relaxation.

## Reading Pistil Color

As a secondary indicator:
- 50–70% orange/brown pistils → Getting close; check trichomes
- 70–90% orange/brown pistils → Usually within the harvest window
- Pistil color alone is not reliable — always confirm with trichome assessment
